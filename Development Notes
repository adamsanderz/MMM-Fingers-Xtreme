This file will contain a set of notes that I make when I'm developing the game, about stuff that I do, stuff that I don't do, and so on. It's not documentation. Just the developer's notes as he develops the project.

I'm gonna need a globals file with the following properties:
	
	GameOver : bool
	SlowMotion : bool
	Score : long
	SlowMotionRatio: float

I'll add more as I need them.

The player need's two controllers during development: A Leap Motion Hand Controller and a Mouse Controller. Separated by a PlayerController script.

There's a debug Mode in the Globals that should not be set outside. Set initially to false when shipping the game.

Game Loop So far:

* The Player finds himself a safe spot, where he doesn't need to move, until he notices an obstacle blocking his path.
* He then slows time down to navigate the obstacle, to move back to  step one.

Lets look at why he does that.

* The enemies move in a completely random way. He isn't notified of the way the enemies move in. The move patterns, the speed, and all that stuff.
* Since he can't predict the paths of the enemies, his best bet is to find a safe spot and stick to it, only moving out of it whenever necessary.

The objective game loop, however, entails the person using time to analyse the path ahead of him and to figure out what he needs to do to navigate that area.

I think just simply not making the game faster as time progresses will give the player an incentive to plan and collect the coins.

However, that still doesn't force the player to move. As in, the puzzles are still simple enough not to involve any player movement to solve them.

This is however, due to the randomness of the game, of the levels, and so on at this point. I should be able to solve it when I get back to this and focus on recreating the game.
