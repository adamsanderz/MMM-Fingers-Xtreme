This file will contain a set of notes that I make when I'm developing the game, about stuff that I do, stuff that I don't do, and so on. It's not documentation. Just the developer's notes as he develops the project.

I'm gonna need a globals file with the following properties:
	
	GameOver : bool
	SlowMotion : bool
	Score : long
	SlowMotionRatio: float

I'll add more as I need them.

The player need's two controllers during development: A Leap Motion Hand Controller and a Mouse Controller. Separated by a PlayerController script.

There's a debug Mode in the Globals that should not be set outside. Set initially to false when shipping the game.
